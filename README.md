# COMP3925_Grp3_COVID19
COMP3925 Group Project - COVID-19 Data Analysis (Python, PowerBI and Web Development)

This is a group project for a course COMP3925: Data Analysis Studio. 

Group Members: 
1. ONG Jun Kye, Eric
2. Palden Dolkar Lama
3. Cheung Chi Fan

We collected data from 2 sources:
1. Our World in Data. https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data
2. The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at John Hopkins University. https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

We then used Python to cleaned the data as some of the datasets were showing cumulative data instead of daily data.
Here are the datasets that we cleaned using Python:
1. covid19_confirmed_unpivoted.csv
2. time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv
3. time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv
4. vaccinations (1).csv

After that, we complied the datasets into Compiled COVID-19 Dataset.xlsx that contains 4 sheets:
1. Confirmed cases
2. Death
3. Recovered
4. Vaccinations

Power BI is used to connect all the data sources to build data analysis and visualizations.
